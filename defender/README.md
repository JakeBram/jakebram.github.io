## This React Application was developed for Defender Police Supply, LLC.

The process of development can be replicated by cloning this git repository, ensuring all dependencies in package.json are installed on your machine, and running 'npm start' in the directory to run on a local server. Dependencies listed include depencencies necessary for full web deployment. For this, ensure the scripts in package.json matches this repository, and run 'npm run build' to create a development build, and 'npm run deploy' to deploy it to github pages.

Similar applications can be developed incredibly easily by copying the boiler code for a react app and again using 'npm start'. I leveraged ChatGPT and other generative AI tools to generate code for components and specific elements I wanted present on my page, and these components can be quickly added or edited using something as powerful as react. Through July, 17th I have put about two weeks worth of effort into this project with minimal resistance leveraging generative AI to help me create my ideas more efficiently. React is incredibly powerful, and ChatGPT can make an engineer program twice as fast. 

Feel free to clone this repository as a starting place for a new project, or for educational purposes.
